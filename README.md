# Machine-Learning-by-Stanford-University
This repository contains my assignments of Coursera's Machine Learning course taught by the professor Andrew Ng offered by Stanford University

By the time you finish this course, you’ll know how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems. You'll also know how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become expert at ‘debugging’ and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance.
