This week, we will be learning about unsupervised learning. While supervised learning algorithms need labeled examples (x,y), unsupervised learning algorithms need only the input (x). You will learn about clusteringâ€”which is used for market segmentation, text summarization, among many other applications.

We will also be introducing Principal Components Analysis, which is used to speed up learning algorithms, and is sometimes incredibly useful for visualizing and helping you to understand your data.
