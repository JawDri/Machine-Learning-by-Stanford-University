In Week 6, we will be learning about systematically improving your learning algorithm. This week will teach you how to tell when a learning algorithm is doing poorly, and describe the 'best practices' for how to 'debug' your learning algorithm and go about improving its performance.

We will also be covering machine learning system design. To optimize a machine learning algorithm, youâ€™ll need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made.
